print("üõ†Ô∏è FIXES IMPLEMENTED:")
print("   1. Enhanced form detection logic:")
print("      - Content-based detection takes priority over filename")
print("      - Better pattern matching for L-43 voting activity forms")
print("      - Special handling for stewardship code documents")

print("   3. Updated configuration:")
print("      - Added L-43 and L-44 form types to HDFC config")

print("üéØ IMPACT:")
print("   - Resolves the 'Unknown extraction error' for L-44 files")
print("   - Ensures robust handling of misnamed/misclassified PDFs")
print("   - Provides comprehensive data extraction even for edge cases")
print("   - Improves overall extraction reliability")
