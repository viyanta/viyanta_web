# HDFC Fallback Logic Fix - Complete Resolution

## Issue Identified ✅

The user reported that HDFC has Gemini-corrected JSON files but they weren't displaying in the frontend, with the system not falling back to extracted JSON files either.

## Root Cause Found 🔍

**Company Directory Naming Mismatch**: The backend fallback logic in `routes/pdf_splitter.py` was looking for company directories with the wrong naming convention:

- **Frontend sends**: `hdfc_life` (underscore format)
- **Gemini directory exists as**: `hdfc life` (space format) 
- **Extractions directory exists as**: `hdfc_life` (underscore format)

The `find_company_dir()` function was not properly converting between underscore and space formats, causing it to miss the Gemini-corrected JSON files.

## Fix Applied 🔧

**File**: `backend/routes/pdf_splitter.py`
**Function**: `find_company_dir()` in the `get_extracted_data` endpoint

**Before**:
```python
def find_company_dir(base_path: Path, company_name: str):
    company_slug = company_name.lower().replace(" ", "_")
    company_spaced = company_name.lower()  # ❌ This doesn't convert underscore to space
```

**After**:
```python  
def find_company_dir(base_path: Path, company_name: str):
    company_slug = company_name.lower().replace(" ", "_")
    company_spaced = company_name.lower().replace("_", " ")  # ✅ Now properly converts both ways
    
    # Try underscore version first
    underscore_path = base_path / company_slug
    if underscore_path.exists():
        return underscore_path

    # Try spaced version
    spaced_path = base_path / company_spaced
    if spaced_path.exists():
        return spaced_path

    # Try original input as-is
    original_path = base_path / company_name.lower()
    if original_path.exists():
        return original_path
```

## Results ✅

**Perfect Fallback Logic Now Working**:

1. **L-4, L-10, L-2, etc.**: ✅ Serves Gemini-corrected JSON from `gemini_verified_json/hdfc life/`
2. **L-44**: ✅ Falls back to extracted JSON from `extractions/hdfc_life/`  
3. **L-1, etc.**: ✅ Shows "No extraction data found" when no data exists

## Data Inventory 📊

**HDFC has extensive Gemini-corrected data available**:
- **Gemini-verified JSONs**: 20+ forms in `gemini_verified_json/hdfc life/HDFC Life  S FY2023 9M/`
- **Extracted JSONs**: 1 form (L-44) in `extractions/hdfc_life/HDFC Life  S FY2023 9M/`
- **Total PDF splits**: 46 forms available

## Fallback Priority Order 🎯

The system now correctly implements this priority:
1. **Gemini-verified JSON** (highest priority) - `gemini_verified_json/`
2. **Corrected JSON** (medium priority) - `extractions/[company]/[pdf]/[form]_corrected.json`
3. **Extracted JSON** (lowest priority) - `extractions/[company]/[pdf]/[form]_extracted.json`
4. **"No extraction data found"** (when no files exist)

## Testing Results 🧪

```
🎯 COMPLETE HDFC SYSTEM TEST
✅ Passed: 3/3
❌ Failed: 0/3
🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

## Impact 🚀

- **Frontend now displays Gemini-corrected data** for 20+ HDFC forms that were previously showing "No extraction data found"
- **Maintains proper fallback** to extracted JSON when Gemini data isn't available
- **No changes needed in frontend** - the issue was purely backend routing
- **Works for all companies** with similar directory naming patterns

The HDFC extraction system is now fully functional with proper fallback logic! 🎉
