# User-Based Explorer Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Viyanta PDF extraction system has been successfully updated to implement a user-based folder structure with Firebase authentication. The system now organizes uploads and displays data based on the authenticated user.

## Folder Structure
```
vifiles/users/{user_id}/{folder_name}/
├── pdf/              # Original PDF files
└── json/             # Extracted JSON data
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Firebase Authentication Integration
- **User Authentication**: Uses Firebase auth to identify users
- **User-based Storage**: All uploads are organized by Firebase user ID
- **Session Management**: Persistent login across browser sessions

### 2. Backend API Updates
All endpoints now require `user_id` and `folder_name` parameters:
- `POST /upload-folder-files/{user_id}/{folder_name}` - Upload PDFs
- `GET /user-folders/{user_id}` - List user's folders
- `GET /user-folder-files/{user_id}/{folder_name}` - List files in folder
- `GET /user-json-data/{user_id}/{folder_name}/{json_filename}` - Get extracted JSON

### 3. AWS S3 Integration
- **User-based S3 storage**: Files stored in S3 with user-specific prefixes
- **Metadata tracking**: S3 objects include user and folder metadata
- **Dual storage**: Files stored both locally and in S3

### 4. Two-Panel Explorer UI (`Explorer_updated.jsx`)

#### Left Panel - Folders & Files
- **Folder View**: Shows user's folders with file counts
- **File View**: Shows files within selected folder
- **User Info**: Displays authenticated user details
- **S3 Folders**: Shows folders stored in AWS S3

#### Right Panel - JSON Data Viewer
- **Table Display**: Structured tables with headers and data
- **Page Navigation**: Browse through multi-page extractions
- **Table Metadata**: Shows accuracy, row/column counts, extraction method
- **Text Preview**: View raw extracted text

### 5. Data Display Features
- **Structured Tables**: JSON data displayed as formatted tables
- **Table Headers**: Proper column headers from extraction
- **Row Limits**: Shows first 10 rows with pagination info
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Displays extraction confidence scores
- **File Metadata**: Size, creation date, extraction status

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in via Firebase
2. Firebase provides unique user ID (UID)
3. All API calls include the user ID
4. Backend validates and stores data in user-specific folders

### Upload Process
1. User selects folder name and PDF files
2. Files uploaded to `vifiles/users/{user_id}/{folder_name}/pdf/`
3. JSON extraction results stored in `vifiles/users/{user_id}/{folder_name}/json/`
4. Files also uploaded to S3 with user metadata

### Data Retrieval
1. Explorer loads user's folders on authentication
2. User selects folder to view files
3. User selects file to view extracted JSON
4. JSON displayed as structured tables in right panel

## File Organization
```
frontend/src/pages/
├── Explorer.jsx           # Original (legacy)
├── ExplorerNew.jsx       # Intermediate version
└── Explorer_updated.jsx   # Current implementation (used in App.jsx)

backend/
├── routes/folder_uploader.py  # User-based upload endpoints
├── services/s3_service.py     # S3 operations with user context
└── main.py                    # Static file serving for vifiles
```

## API Testing
- `test_simple_api.py` - Tests basic upload and retrieval
- `test_new_api.py` - Tests complete user workflow
- `test_tables_api.py` - Tests table extraction quality

## Current Status ✅
- ✅ Firebase authentication integrated
- ✅ User-based folder structure implemented
- ✅ Backend APIs updated for user context
- ✅ S3 integration with user metadata
- ✅ Two-panel Explorer UI completed
- ✅ JSON data displayed as structured tables
- ✅ Local and S3 data browsing
- ✅ All tests passing

## Usage Instructions
1. **Login**: Access the app and login with Firebase
2. **Upload**: Use Smart PDF Extraction to upload PDFs to folders
3. **Browse**: Navigate to Explorer to view your folders and files
4. **View Data**: Select files to see extracted JSON as formatted tables
5. **Navigate**: Use breadcrumbs to navigate between folders and files

The system is now fully functional with user-based organization and a modern maker-checker UI that displays both original PDFs and extracted JSON data in a clean two-panel interface.
